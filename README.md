# <Eric's Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

From the end of March 2022 to the end of May 2022 I was teaching myself to propgram websites due to the accessiblity of information. I built this application to showcase what I've done so far in the Bootcamp with MSU. I have built an application similar to this but only with HTML, CSS, and Notepad. The problem with the previous appplication I built was due to lack of information and tools. Visual Studio Code was already installed on my computer but I didn't know how to use it and I was already comfortable with Notepad++. I also did not know how to use GitBash, same problem with VS Code the syntax and how it operates is confusing at times and my source of information, in this case YouTube, was scattered so knowing how put all of it together was extremely time consuming. I also had a GitHub account but just like the issue with the other two I just didn't know where to start. So I watched the YouTube tutorials on where to start and what to use. This application solves the note taking issue, while I can jot down all of my notes I would have to add more context to them. Combining all of my notes into an application makes it more accessible and faster when I need specific information. Yes I could Google all of the information I forgot but like I said accessibility and quickness. Also, I find slightly different information compared to what I've learned in the Bootcamp. I learned some new things with CSS. JavaScript was the next thing on my list the last time I programmed a website, so I learned a lot from it I still don't understand it enough to do it on my own yet (9/23/2022). Using the GitBash terminal is still a beast in my opinion, I need to practice more with it. I'm new to using Github. There is a game called Twilio Quest that teaches you how to use Github. Its challenging at first but once you stick it out its not so bad. VS Code is a lot easier to use than I previously thought, especially with the commit and branch editors within the program compared to using the Terminal.
